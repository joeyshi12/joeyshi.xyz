title: Joey Shi - Software Developer

Hello ðŸ‘‹. I'm a professional full-stack developer @ [Visier](https://www.visier.com/).

I work on interactive dataflow visualization libraries and various HCM data extractors.
In my role, I helped drive many different projects,
delivered impactful feature demos to the company, and mentored new developers.

Outside of work, I enjoy tinkering with different kinds of software and learning new things.
You can find some of my works listed [here](/projects/).

Feel free to connect! I'm always up for discussions about productivity tools,
computer graphics, and Linux ricing (I use Arch and Neovim btw).
