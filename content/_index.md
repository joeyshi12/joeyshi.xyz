title: Joey Shi - Software Engineer

Hello 👋. I’m a professional software engineer @ Amazon.

I focus on improving system reliability, application security, and developer efficiency.
My recent work includes developing a first-responder AI agent for Amazon on-calls
and fixing application security vulnerabilities during on-call.

Previously, I was a full-stack software developer @ [Visier](https://www.visier.com/).
I built interactive [dataflow visualizations](https://docs.visier.com/visier-people/Studio/data/data-flow-visualization.htm) to provide users a clear understanding of their data's journey
and I developed [HCM data connectors](https://docs.visier.com/visier-people/Studio/data/data%20connectors/data-connectors.htm) to automate data onboarding.
In this role, I delivered impactful feature demos and mentored new engineers.

Outside of work, I enjoy tinkering with different kinds of software and learning new things. You can find some of my works listed [here](/projects/).
Feel free to connect! I’m always up for discussions about productivity tools, computer graphics, and Linux ricing (I use Arch and Neovim btw).
