A collection of web games I made and host.

- [Game Website](https://play.joeyshi.xyz/)
    - Platform Party - A real-time multiplayer 2D platformer.
    - Snake - The classic snake game with a high-score board.
- [Source code](https://github.com/joeyshi12/joeys-games)

These games were made primarily using TypeScript and the HTML5 canvas API.

## Image processing

The first API I leveraged was the canvas scripting API, which offered useful image processing functions.
To start using this feature, I added a canvas element in my main HTML template file

```html
 <canvas id="game"></canvas>
```

Then, I get the [CanvasRenderingContext2D](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D)
interface from this element in a separate script.

```javascript
 const ctx = document.getElementById("game").getContext("2d")
```

This interface contains useful methods, such as

```javascript
 drawImage(bitmap, x, y, width, height)
```

which I use to draw sprites on the screen.
This method requires the image in the form of a image bitmap
and to do that, we can use [createImageBitmap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/createImageBitmap),
which returns a `Promise<ImageBitmap>`.

```javascript
createImageBitmap(image)
createImageBitmap(image, options)
createImageBitmap(image, sx, sy, sw, sh)
createImageBitmap(image, sx, sy, sw, sh, options)
```
