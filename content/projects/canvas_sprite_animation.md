I had some time off this week and decided the best way to spend that
time was to start another random project.
So, I implemented an animation system for Pokemon Mystery Dungeon sprites in vanilla JavaScript.

- [Source code](https://github.com/joeyshi12/zorflendex.space)
- [PMD collab sprites](https://sprites.pmdcollab.org/#/)

This was inspired by a friend's suggestion to make the mii maker plaza,
where you can view all your mii creations and drag them around the screen.

I ended up going with 2D Pokemon sprite animations since my group and I found it more aesthetic.
I let some Pokemon loose on this page, but I've disabled interactions since their interactions conflict with other elements with transparent backgrounds.
But, you can try out the drag-and-drop interaction at https://zorflendex.space.
