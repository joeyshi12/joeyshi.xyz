      <description>This post goes over some of the mathematics involved in panning and zooming in graphical applications.&#xA;Points can be described in world space or view space. The world space is a linear basis that describes where objects positioned relative to the world while the view space is a basis that is used to describe points relative to the view that the user sees.&#xA;When panning or zooming in the view, a different translation and scale is being applied to view coordinates to determine what slice of the world should be drawn in the view.</description>

      <description>A desktop application that uses the finite difference method to solve differential equations.&#xA;PyPI Page Source code This application uses techniques from these lecture notes to compute the solution of PDEs numerically.&#xA;Numerical algorithm for solving the heat equation We let $u(t, x)$ be the solution function for the differential equation defined by&#xA;$$ \begin{align} \text{PDE}:\quad &amp;amp;u_{t}(t, x) = \alpha u_{xx}(t, x) + S(t, x), 0 &amp;lt; x \leq L, 0 &amp;lt; t \leq T \\ \text{BC}:\quad &amp;amp;u(t, 0) = \Phi_1(t),\quad u_{t}(t, L) = \Phi_2(t) \\ \text{IC}:\quad &amp;amp;u(0, x) = f(x) \end{align} $$</description>

      <title>Extending the Fibonacci sequence to the real domain</title>

      <description>The Fibonacci sequence can be written out as $0, 1, 1, 2, 3,\dots$, where the following terms is defined by the sum of the 2 previous terms. Letting $f(n)$ denote the $n$-th term of the sequence, we can write this as $f(n+2) = f(n+1) + f(n)$ with initial values $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 1$.&#xA;Finding a closed formula To find a closed formula for this sequence, we can use the classic Characteristic Root Technique from discrete mathematics.</description>
